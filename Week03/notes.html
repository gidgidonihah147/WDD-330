            <ul class="nested">
                <p class="note">Questions for the Teacher</p>
                <ol>

                <li>Objects are often used to keep any related information and functionality together in the same place. For example, if you wrote functions that found the perimeter and area of a square, you might want to group them together as methods of the same object that also included a length property. </li>
                    <li><p>
                            Creating Objects
                            To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. The following example creates an empty object that is assigned to the variable spiderman :
                            const spiderman = {};
                            It’s also possible to create an object using a constructor function. This example will also create an empty object:
                            const spiderman = new Object();
                            This method is not recommended, however, and the object literal notation is the preferred way of creating objects. The obvious reason is because it requires less typing and provides a concise way of initializing an object and its properties in one statement. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Another way is to use the hasOwnProperty() method. As mentioned earlier, objects can inherit properties from other objects, so all objects have a method called hasOwnProperty() . This can be used to check whether an object has a property that is its own, rather than one that has been inherited from another object:
                            superman.hasOwnProperty('city');
                            << false
                            superman.hasOwnProperty('name');
                            << true
                            This method willonlyreturn any properties that belong to that particular object, whereas using in or !== undefined will return true , even if the property has been inherited from another object (inheritance is covered later in Chapter 12).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes by code sharing the same scope. This might not seem likely, but imagine if you have lots of code that has been created over time – you might end up reusing a variable name without realizing. The problem becomes more likely if you use code libraries from other developers or work on code in teams, as you might choose the same name for a function as another member of the team.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <h4>JSON</h4>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The Math.floor() method will round a numberdownto the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer:
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A Practical Example
                            If we were looking for PDF files and had a list of filenames, this regular expression could be used to find them (assuming they have a .pdf extension, of course):
                                const pdf = /.*\.pdf$/;
                            This looks for zero or more occurrences of any character, followed by an escaped period, followed by the letters " pdf " that must come at the end of the string:
                                pdf.test('chapter5.pdf');
                                true
                                pdf.test('report.doc');
                                false
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Matched Groups
                                Sub-patterns can be created inside a regular expression by placing them inside parentheses. These are known ascapturing groups. Any matches to these will then be stored in an array of matches.
                                Each capturing group is numbered according to the position it appears in the pattern. For example, the first capturing group will be numbered 1, and the second 2, etc. The matches will also be stored in special predefined variables $1 , $2 etc.
                                To demonstrate this, here's an example that searches a string and replaces any HTML anchor tags withMarkdownnotation:
                                The example has two capturing groups – the first captures any text inside the href attribute and stores it in the variable $1 and the second captures the text inside the anchor tags and stores it in the variable $2 . These matches can then be used to create the link using Markdown.

                            The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find thefirstelement in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return null.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list ofallthe elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an empty node list. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                            That The parentNode property returns the parent node of an element.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The node lists returned by the document.getElementsByClassName() and document.getElementsByTagName() methods arelivecollections that will update to reflect any changes on the page. For example, if a new element with the class hero is added, or an existing one is removed, the node list updates automatically without having to make another call to the method. Therefore, its use is discouraged for performance reasons, but it can be useful.

            <ul class="nested">
                <p>This week there were a few new things, or things I just forgot with the objects chapter. I did also learn quite a bit about the DOM that I didnt know. There wasnt alot that I didnt understand with it or thought that I needed to take notes on however. With chapter 7, I struggled previously in classes using and understanding events and how they work so I dived into them quite a bit. </p>
                <p>I did also spend some of my time this week to create another website for a friend of mine. Its not complete yet, but I have started it. <a href="https://gidgidonihah147.github.io/Color-with-Kiri/products.html">Website</a></p>
                <p>The strech goal in the team assignment was also interesting this week. We got it to work, but I am confused by a little bit of it and want to take more time to go back through it and make sure how it worked so that I could replicate it if I needed to.</p>
