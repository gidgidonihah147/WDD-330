            <h2>Ch2: Programming basics</h2>
            <p>Much of this should be review, but pay special attention to the sections on variables, scope, converting/parsing, and template literals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Well commented code is a halmarc of a JavaScript ninja. You will thank yourself later.</li>
                <li>You dont NEED to place ; at the end of each statement. But it has the chance of causing errors not to, so its best practice.</li>
                <li>You can use white space to keep your code neat and easy to read.</li>
                <li>Make an effort to memorize all of the reserved words for JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Cost varriable will be used when the variable wont be reassigned later. let allows a variable to be redefined.</li>
                <li>To be able to predict what your program will do, you should use Const more so. This helps keep your code from breaking due to variables changing.</li>
                <li>var = older version of let</li>
                <li>Be careful with global scope. It may seem nice but as your code gets bigger, it can get messy fast.</li>
                <li>Be smart about your naming of variables</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

            <h2>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
            <p>Again much of this should feel like review. Pay special attention to the section on array methods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each item in an array can be treated like a variable</li>
                <li>Any blanks in an array are filled with the value "undefined"</li>
                <li>You can define multiple variables within an array at once</li>
                <li>use pop over delete when removing variables from arrays</li>
                <li>splice replaces current array items with another item</li>
                <li>?Why would you use an array over a set?</li>
                <li>Answer - Will not allow duplicate value's.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Leak - memory is being used to store value that is no longer eing used by the program, effectively wasting system recources</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <h2>Ch4: Functions</h2>
            <p>Note that there are multiple ways to declare a function in Javascript. Pay close attention to the concept of callbacks as well.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most common way to define a function is called "arrow"</li>
                <li>All functions have a read only property called name</li>
                <li>Adding functions through constructors are messy and best to avoid</li>
                <li>Keep your code DRY - Do not repeat yourself. All parts of code should only be written once</li>
                <li>You always need "()" to invoke the function. otherwise, you will just call the function, not run it</li>
                <li>Any perameters will need to be within the "()" to call an argument with perameters</li>
            </ul>
