        <h3>Localstorage in Doing Stuff with Web Things.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ive never saved anything to local storage before. I knew how to format everything else, but just didnt know how to do that.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Github portfolio</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For some reason I had a really hard time understanding and following the process on the instructions listed on creating a portfolio. I think a part of that was just due to
                the fact that github has changed their website so things werent listed the same.
            </li>
            <li>I got my portfolio created and got the pages working correctly, but I'm not positive that I got the main page correct.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Premium access is still pending - cant watch video yet. Will update once I have login and can watch the video.</li>
        </ul>
