                    <li>If you could look over my extra code on the team assignment and give feedback on that, I would greatly appreciate it. There were quite a few things there that I wanted to try out and was new to me. I'm sure that there were easier ways to do what I wanted but I couldnt find them.</li>
                    <li>I added the code to import the classes for each selection so the CSS could work. I also added the clear out for those classes so when you hit reset it would clear those out. Then I added the current player alongside the turn, and created a counter for each player</li>

                        The search form is super cool, I want to learn more about that and what the keywords would be and how to enter that into code.

                    </li>

                        Form Validation can check things like the following

                            <li>A required field is completed</li>
                            <li>An email address is valid</li>
                            <li>A number is entered when numerical data is required</li>
                            <li>A password is at least a minimum number of characters</li>
                            <li>And so much more</li>

                        I have taken classes on both python and c++ so I know a bit about OOP. The only thing that I noted here was the difference in syntax between python and Javascript.

                    <li>
                        With the use of modular Javascript, is it common practice to only have the imports inside of the main.js and have each function inside its own file in order to help organize things?
                    </li>

                    This consept is really really cool to me. I always have issues with navagating my Javascript and making sure I know where everything is. With this I thnk I will be able to keep better track of things.

                    This week I am in the process of moving so I wasnt able to do as much as I wanted to outside of the base requirements of the assignments. I did have some fun with the team project. After we all hopped off, I just kept thinking, "oh that would be cool to have in here" and didnt stop until my wife demanded that I turn it off and head to bed.

                    I'm finding more and more that alot of the readings in general are things that I already know, but what I dont know are the subtle things or things that I have only used once, know what they are in theory, but wouldnt be able to say what it was if I needed to without looking it up. I think that part will just come with practice through.
